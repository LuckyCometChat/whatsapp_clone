# Media Messaging Implementation Notes

## Overview

We have implemented media messaging functionality in the WhatsApp clone, allowing users to send images, videos, and audio files in conversations.

## Components Added

1. **Media Service Function**
   - Added `sendMediaMessage` function to the CometChat service
   - Handles different media types: images, videos, and audio

2. **Media Attachment UI**
   - Added attachment button to the chat input
   - Created a modal with different media options (camera, gallery, audio, video)
   - Platform-specific handling for iOS (ActionSheet) and Android (Modal)

3. **Permission Handling**
   - Added permission request functions for camera and storage
   - Platform-specific implementation for Android and iOS

4. **Media Capture & Selection**
   - Implemented camera access for taking photos
   - Added gallery access for selecting images
   - Added document picker for audio files
   - Added video selection

5. **Media Rendering**
   - Updated message rendering to support different media types
   - Added custom UI components for images, videos, and audio
   - Implemented placeholders for media types

## Key Files Modified

1. **src/services/cometChat.ts**
   - Added `sendMediaMessage` function

2. **src/types/index.ts**
   - Updated `ChatMessage` interface to include media properties

3. **src/components/Chat.tsx**
   - Added media attachment handling
   - Updated UI to display media messages
   - Added permission requests

## Required Dependencies

The implementation uses the following packages:
- `react-native-image-picker` - For camera and gallery access
- `react-native-document-picker` - For selecting audio files
- `react-native-vector-icons` - For UI icons

## Notes for Future Improvement

1. **Video Playback**
   - Add a proper video player component to handle video playback
   - Implement video thumbnails generation

2. **Audio Player**
   - Add a custom audio player with play/pause controls
   - Show audio duration and progress

3. **Image Optimization**
   - Add image compression before upload
   - Implement image preview and cropping

4. **Media Download**
   - Add functionality to download media to the device
   - Implement caching for better performance

## Known Issues

1. The current implementation requires permissions to be granted before use. If permissions are denied, the app will show an alert but may not function properly.

2. Video thumbnails are using a placeholder rather than generating actual thumbnails from the video.

3. Large media files may take time to upload, and there's currently no progress indicator.

## Testing Notes

- Test all media types on both iOS and Android 
- Ensure all permissions are properly requested
- Verify that sent media appears correctly for both the sender and receiver
